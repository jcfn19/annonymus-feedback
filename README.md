### Important info

# will try with just ts no framework like react!

 == the backend is now running however sending the form to the database in the ts/main version does not work! ==

 == when cloneing this repo you need to run `npm run build` to get the dist folder! ==

 ## Update

 == since the ts version doesn't fully work i am planning on moving the project over from vite.js to next.js. this means that the backend will most likely not use express.js. ==

 == for now the next.js version will be in a seperate folder, altough it wil eventually replace the main/ts version ==

# annonymus-feedback
